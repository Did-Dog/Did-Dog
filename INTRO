GameMaker accommodates the creation of cross-platform
and multi-genre video games using a custom drag-and-drop visual programming language or a scripting language known as Game Maker Language, 
which can be used to develop more advanced games that could not be created just by using the drag and drop features. GameMaker was originally designed 
to allow novice computer programmers to be able to make computer games without much programming knowledge by use of these actions. 
 versions of software also focus on appealing to advanced developers.

GameMaker is primarily intended for making games with 2D graphics, 
allowing out-of-box use of raster graphics, vector graphics (via SWF)
The engine uses Direct3D on Windows, UWP, and Xbox One;
OpenGL on macOS and Linux; OpenGL ES on Android and iOS, 
WebGL or 2d canvas on HTML5, and proprietary APIs on consoles. 

The engine's primary element is an IDE with built-in editors for raster graphics, 
level design, scripting, paths, and shaders (GLSL or HLSL).
Additional functionality can be implemented in software's scripting language or platform-specific native extensions.
In GameMaker Studio 2, you can choose whether to export the game as an NSIS installer, or a .zip file containing the game, 
 data.win file, and any files added under the "Included Files" tab in the editor.

GameMaker was originally developed by Mark Overmars. The program was first released on 15 November 1999 
under the name of Animo (at the time, it was just a graphics tool with limited visual scripting capabilities).
The first versions of the program were being developed in Delphi
Subsequent releases saw the name changed to Game Maker and software moving towards more general-purpose 2D game development.
